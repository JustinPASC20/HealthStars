            <h1>Tip #1: Moderation</h1>
            <p>We're all told from a young age that junk foods like burgers and sodas are terrible for your health and should be avoided at all costs. But this isn't and shouldn't be the case. Junk food is ok to eat, but it's the frequency and amount that matters. Eating a burger with french fries two times a week is fine, but eating it everyday is harmful for your health. In order to balance out the fats and sodium that fast food has, having healthy meals for the other 5 days is recommended. One mcChicken and one order of fries amount to 730 calories. This would be like eating 7 apples or 7 bananas. The fruit option has more nutrients, but it is important to note that it's better to mix fruit with other food groups like protein and grains. </p>
