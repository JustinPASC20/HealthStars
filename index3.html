                    <p>China has the largest population in the entire world and also supplies the most apples  in the world market. They supplied the world with 41 million metric tons in the 2019/2020 season. Apples don't have one specific climate to grow in, since there are different types of apples. There are over 7,000 apple varieties. This is due to farmers around the world needing either crunchy or soft apples. They do this by taking two parent apples, Mom and Dad, then transferring the pollen of the dad's tree to the mother's tree. Then the seeds of the mother's tree are used to make new a type of apple. </p>

                <p>Bananas come from a lot of different countries around the world! The bananas that you have in your house might be from China or India as they are the biggest suppliers in the world. These two countries alone supply more than 40 million tons of bananas per year! Bananas typically grow in the the tropics, where it's warm and wet. This ensures that the bananas you eat come out tasty. One fun fact about bananas is that they are all genetically identical! This means that all bananas are basically clones of one another, but this same power also makes them weak to diseases.  </p>

                        <p>The United States is one of the largest producers of blueberries. Maine alone is responsible for 10% or 50 million pounds of blueberry exports/deliveries. This means that the United States as a country, produces over 500 million pounds of blueberries per year. Blueberries grow in colder climates, around 45 degrees Fahrenheit. One fun fact about blueberries is that one blueberry bush can produce up to 6,000  blueberries! </p>
